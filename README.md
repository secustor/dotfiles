# dotfiles

## Introduction

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repository! ðŸŽ‰

This is where I store my custom configuration files for various tools and environments I use. These dotfiles are tailored specifically to my needs and preferences, aiming to streamline my workflow and enhance productivity.

> [!NOTE]
> These configurations are designed **exclusively for my personal use**.
> Feel free to explore and get inspiration, but please use with caution and adapt configurations to suit your own setup if needed!â€‹
